/**
 * Why not First Meaningful Paint (FMP)
 * In the past we've recommended performance metrics like First Meaningful Paint (FMP) and Speed Index (SI) (both available
 * in Lighthouse) to help capture more of the loading experience after the initial paint,
 * but these metrics are complex, hard to explain,
 * and often wrongâ€”meaning they still do not identify when the main content of the page has loaded.
 * (https://web.dev/lcp/)
 *
 * The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport,
 * relative to when the page first started loading.
